subtitle: Ph.D. candidate at University of Pennsylvania
---

My name is Entao Yang and I am a Ph.D. candidate at Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS), University of Pennsylvania. My research mainly focuses on using MD simulation and machine learning techniques to probe and study hidden physics in amorphous materials. I have developed/co-developed three physical models and one machine learning algorithm during my graduate study.

- Dynamical Decomposition Model in Polymer Nanocomposites 
- [Structure-dependent Eyring Model (StEM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06016)
- Structuro-elasto-plasticity (StEP) model
- Transfer-learned softness: an algorithm connects softness (a machine-learned structual field) in the heterogenous system to the well-dispersed system and enables training on small scale data sets.

### My story

Before came to Penn, I did my undergraduate at Tianjin University, China, majoring in Chemical Engineering. During my undergraduate, I received Chinese Government Scholarship for Study Abroad and went to Texas A&M University to do my thesis (dust explosion and hazards). I had another dual bachelor's degree from Nankai University, majoring in Finance, and my thesis is about the effects of Two-child policy on Chinese saving rate. I have also been to the Georgia Institute of Technology as a summer exchange student.
