My name is Entao Yang and I am a Ph.D. candidate at Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS), University of Pennsylvania. My research mainly focuses on using MD simulation and mahcine learning technique to probe and study hidden physics in amorphous materials. I have developed/co-developed three physical models and one machine learning algorithm during my graduate study.

- Dynamical Decomposition Model in Polymer Nanocomposites
- Structure-dependent Eyring Model (StEM)
- Structuro-elasto-plasticity (StEP) model
- Transfer-learned softness: an algorithm connects softness (a machine-learned structual field) in the heterogenous system to the well-dispersed system and enables training on small scale data sets and.

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
